            I am majoring in Game Design and Development, mostly because it is the overlap between most of my hobbies. I've loved computer science since elementary school, but shortly before starting applyting to college I realized that drawing and writing were a lot of fun, and that I wanted to become a lot better at them. I hope to learn to make more functional websites in this class, mostly for my portfolio. At RIT in general I'm hoping to learn the lower level concepts I had more trouble teaching myself, like shaders and optimization. I don't care much what I do after I graduate, as long as it's something adjacent to computer science.
